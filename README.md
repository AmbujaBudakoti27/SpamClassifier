# Spam Mail Detection

Spam detection is one of the applications of Machine Learning today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail' or 'Spam'.

Here I have used the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. I have further experimented with using SVM algorthim.

This is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam'. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model.

### Highest accuracy achieved over test data:
